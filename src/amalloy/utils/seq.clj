(defmacro lazy-loop
  "Provide a simplified version of lazy-seq to eliminate
  boilerplate. Arguments are as to the built-in (loop...recur),
  and (lazy-recur) will be defined for you. However, instead of doing
  actual tail recursion, lazy-recur trampolines through lazy-seq. In
  addition to enabling laziness, this means you can call lazy-recur
  when not in the tail position."

(defn unfold
  "Traditionally unfold is the 'opposite of reduce': it turns a single seed value into a (possibly infinite) lazy sequence of output values.

Next and done? are functions that operate on a seed. next should
  return a pair, [value new-seed]; the value half of the pair is
  inserted into the resulting list, while the new-seed is used to
  continue unfolding. Notably, the value is never passed as an
  argument to either next or done?.

  If done? is omitted, the sequence will be unfolded forever, for example
  (defn fibs []
    (unfold (fn [[a b]]
              [a [b (+ a b)]])
            [0 1]))"
